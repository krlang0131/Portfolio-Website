            <h3>Proposal</h3>
            <p>Supreme PDR is a newly established small business in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania area. With competitors in the region, they aim to stand out through strong branding and a professional online presence. I worked closely with the client to develop a cohesive brand identity, designing their website, logo, and style guide to align with their vision. They requested a sleek, modern, single-page design with a dark aesthetic, highlighting their services and showcasing a gallery of completed work.</p>

            <h4>Role</h4>
            <p>Graphic Designer, Web Designer, Web Developer</p>
            <h4>Tools</h4>

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>Preliminary research showed a number of PDR compeitiors in the Lehigh Valley area. After a compeitive audit of compeitiors sites it became clear the problems those sites had:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Not enough information about product and services.</li>
            <li>   or   </li>
            <li>2. Too much unorganized information and photos, creating confusing web flow.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Research Conclusion</h4>
          <p>Supreme PDR needs a site that properly describes what the service is that they provide, as many people do not know what PDR is. In addition to a list of the explained services they provide and how they stack up to the compeitiion. A photo gallery section is necessary as visual proof of quality work and showcases range of repairs. </p>

        <div class="info-container">
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>In the initial wireframing phase, I focused on organizing content in a way that would provide a clear and informative flow for users. This involved determining the key sections needed to effectively communicate Supreme PDR’s services, expertise, and completed work. Given the client’s request for a single-page design, I carefully structured the layout to guide visitors smoothly through the most important information—starting with an engaging introduction, followed by a breakdown of services, a showcase of completed work, and an easy-to-access contact section. My goal was to create a seamless user experience that balances aesthetics with functionality while ensuring potential customers can quickly find the information they need.</p>

          <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
          <p>Worked closely with the client to design a clean contemporary logo. Tamrin font was chosen for the logo and main headings of the site. It has a minilaistic design with balanced proportions to esure high readability and versitile in differing forms of branding.
          <p>Dark color scheme was chosen with colors based off the range of hues found in fog. Giving layers of depth to the black background.</p>

          <h3>Final Design</h3>
          <p>Web development was created in WordPress. Client requested a video to play in the intro. Pulling the user's gaze to the center where the logo fades into view on load. Web design has a dark color scheme with high contrast images. All top navigation scrolls to differing sections on the sigle page layout.</p>
          <p>Client requested a way to show off all images from their Instagram account. To accomplish this a plugin was added that links to their Instragram and display all uploaded photos. This became the Gallery section on their site. The plugin updates as more photos are uploaded to Instagram account so the web gallery stays up to date. </p>

          <h3>Branding Advertisements</h3>
          <p>To go along with the new website the client requested digital and print advertistements to attract interest, engagement, and sales for the new business. Created in the software Canva.</p>
