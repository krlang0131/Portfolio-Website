            <p>The Bizarro Branding project had me reassign an entirely new product to an existing company, then re-imagine the branding for that new product. The new product was to be markedly different from the existing product that company currently supplies. I was asked to maintain the spirit of the existing company when creating the branding for its new product or service. The major milestones of the project are: selection of a brand, reassignment of its supplied product or service, development of a new brand position, conceptualization of new branding collateral, production, editing, and distribution.</p>

            <p>I took the existing brand Dunkin' and reimagined this coffee and donut company to now be a shoe company. I created five pieces of branding and advertisments with the revised brand position yet continuing the existing tone of the company's branding. I wanted to keep the existing tag line "America Runs on Dunkin'" and redesign it to a shoe product focus. Dunkin's brand font, coloring, and styling was continued through the redesign.</p>
